Lynden, Inc. is a freight and logistics company based in the Seattle and Anchorage areas. 
”Lynden Navigator”, the application developed by us, has two sets of target users within the company.

We have freight terminals across the lower 48 states and in Alaska and Hawaii, as well as in Canada. 
Navigator was developed to give managers at those terminals the ability to see information regarding 
the freight that is scheduled to arrive at their facility, as well as the freight that is scheduled to 
depart from their facility. This information will help managers to allocate their resources -both human 
and equipment (trucks, trailers, etc.)- more efficiently.

The second set of users of the Navigator application are customer service personnel. Since the Navigator 
application is built on the NetBeans Rich Client Platform, we were able to develop the customer service 
functionality as a NetBeans plug-in and easily integrate it with the Planning portion of the application 
mentioned above. This plug-in will give customer service the ability to search for freight in a variety of 
ways, including by shipment number, customer name, address, etc. The application will then display the 
complete history for a selected freight item as it has moved through our system. Users can also print or 
email documents related to the shipment, including Bills of Lading or Delivery Receipts. New functionality 
for this portion of the application has been developed using JavaFX for the UI components while maintaining
the existing Swing UI components that have remained in place for the other application plug-ins.
