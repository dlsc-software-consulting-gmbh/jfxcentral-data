Understand real-world game development concepts using JavaFX game engine called FXGL. The core focus of the book is on developing a standalone game or application with FXGL.

We will start with an overview of the book followed by requisite concepts from Java and JavaFX that will be used throughout this book. Next, we will learn about the FXGL game engine and its wide range of real-world game development techniques. In the following chapter, we learn about entity-component model used in FXGL to create a powerful abstraction of the game world. The next chapter builds on this, where we develop a platformer game using the physics engine and a popular external tool called Tiled. An important concept of games AI is covered in the following chapter. Visually complex features related to graphics and rendering as well as UI elements and animation system in FXGL will be discussed in the next chapter. The following chapter is dedicated to non-game applications that can be developed using FXGL. The last two chapters cover packaging and deployment of JavaFX and FXGL applications and discussion on future projects.

The key take-away skill from this book is the ability to develop professional-level applications and games with FXGL. During the course of this book, you will have produced a range of cross-platform applications and games using FXGL, reinforcing the game development concepts covered throughout.
