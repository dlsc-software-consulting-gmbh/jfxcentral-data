OpenJFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems based on JavaSE. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications. This is the open source project where we develop JavaFX.
