    "description": "Follow Java Champion Hendrik Ebbers on his story of \"Little Duke's Journey to the Moon\". During this keynote presentation held at JFX Days 2020 on Nov 24, 2020, Hendrik investigates what is wrong with Java in regards of the development of desktop applications. Is this a problem of Java - although it is still one of the most used programming languages? Or is it a problem of Java Desktop respectively JavaFX? Or maybe the problem is the community or - even worse - Oracle itself. \n\nIn this entertaining talk, Hendrik points out that there is no problem with all of the above. Developers need to accept that Java Desktop is a niche. But all together, the community can make this niche shine.",

    "description": "Gluon has been the defacto JavaFX steward since the JavaFX 11 release. Gluon builds and maintains the JavaFX artifacts and makes them available as SDK's as well as on Maven Central. Moving JavaFX forward is often a balance between adding new features and staying at the front of the UI development, while also making sure that the core principles of Java, especially backward compatibility, are respected.\n\u200B\nIn the past year, focus was mainly on the transition to making JavaFX a set of modules that work well with evolving JDK releases as well as integrate with standard build, deploy and devops tools that are popular in the development community. One of the main focusses of JavaFX is to make sure it works on as much platforms as possible: desktop, but also mobile and embedded. In this session, Johan Vos, CEO of Gluon, presented some of the future ideas.",

    "description": "The Java Module System lays the foundation for building modularized applications on the JVM. It doesn't concern itself though with resolving module versions and obtaining modules from repositories. This is where Layrry comes in: an API and launcher for modularized Java applications which takes a descriptor of the module layer(s) to assemble, fetches the modules and starts up the application. Layrry also allows dynamic loading.unloading of plugins which makes it ideal for JavaFX applications, allowing app developers to provide behavior on the fly.\n\nPresented by Andres Almiray at JFX Days 2020.",

    "description": "Modern JavaFX provides hardware acceleration support on a range of platforms, including desktop, mobile and embedded, allowing the development of high-performance cross-platform applications. However, to develop games with JavaFX effectively, numerous domain-specific concepts are needed. \n\nTo address this need, the FXGL game engine extends JavaFX and brings support for real-world game development techniques. These include the entity-component model, A* pathfinding, particle systems, sprite sheet animations and many other features. As a result, JavaFX developers can produce games more quickly and more effectively with FXGL. \n\nIntegrating seamlessly with Gluon's Client plugin, FXGL users can easily package their games to native platform images, including Android and iOS. By the end of this session, attendees will be able to: \n\n- Describe and explain basic FXGL features. \n- Produce a simple game with FXGL.\n\nThis session of Almas Baimagambetov was recorded on Nov 24, 2020 during the JFX-Days 2020.",

    "tags": "research, science, wildlife, academic, sensors",
    "type": "Real World Application",
    "description": "Since the 1960s, indiscriminate fishing techniques using underwater explosives have been widespread across the coastal zone of Tanzania, Africa. So-called “bomb fishing” causes untold damage to the structures (e.g. coral reefs) and soundscapes of marine habitats and the animals within. At its recorded peak in 2016, tens of thousands of bomb blasts were visually recorded along the Tanzanian coastline, with many more likely undetected and unreported, representing a substantial and endemic conservation problem.\n \nGathering data on the location, timing and number of explosions over time is essential for understanding exactly when and where blasting occurs, for alerting enforcement in a timely manner, and for monitoring the effectiveness of any interventions. Listening for bomb blasts underwater (passive acoustic monitoring) has the great advantage over visual observation in that blasts can be detected during both the day and night, and this can be done over thousands of square kilometres.\n \nHowever, such acoustic monitoring schemes generate vast quantities of data which must be automatically analysed. Typically, a machine learning based approach would be used to build an accurate acoustic classifier, however, the combination of little training data on fish bomb blasts and the poorly documented soundscape of Tanzanian reefs mean that building an accurate automated classifier is difficult. Here we instead adopted a hybrid analysis approach, where we ran an automated detector that extracted any sound of interest, and then used JavaFX to build a highly interactive visualisation of the data. This enabled a manual analyst to quickly identify fish bomb blasts, allowing for months of raw data to be sifted through with the times and audio clips of fish bomb blasts extracted in a few hours, compared to the weeks of time it would have taken otherwise.\n \nJavaFX provided the means to build fast and intuitive data visualisation tools, an easy-to-use and attractive GUI, and critically, allowed this to be achieved on modest financial and time budgets. JavaFX enabled real-time conservation in the marine environments, and was key to the success of this (and other) wildlife conservation projects.",

Some JDKs only contain AWT & Swing for desktop development and miss all the newer tools. But even if they include such tools or frameworks you have sometimes no idea about their state.\n\nIn this session I will give an overview about the differences between JDKs that you can use today and how frameworks like JavaFX are really supported by the vendors.
