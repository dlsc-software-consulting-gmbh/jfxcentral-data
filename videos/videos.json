During this keynote presentation held at JFX Days 2020 on Nov 24, 2020, Hendrik investigates what is wrong with Java in regards of the development of desktop applications. Is this a problem of Java - although it is still one of the most used programming languages? Or is it a problem of Java Desktop respectively JavaFX? Or maybe the problem is the community or - even worse - Oracle itself. \n\nIn this entertaining talk, Hendrik points out that there is no problem with all of the above. Developers need to accept that Java Desktop is a niche. But all together, the community can make this niche shine.",

However, to develop games with JavaFX effectively, numerous domain-specific concepts are needed. \n\nTo address this need, the FXGL game engine extends JavaFX and brings support for real-world game development techniques. These include the entity-component model, A* pathfinding, particle systems, sprite sheet animations and many other features. As a result, JavaFX developers can produce games more quickly and more effectively with FXGL. \n\nIntegrating seamlessly with Gluon's Client plugin, FXGL users can easily package their games to native platform images, including Android and iOS. By the end of this session, attendees will be able to: \n\n- Describe and explain basic FXGL features. \n- Produce a simple game with FXGL.\n\nThis session of Almas Baimagambetov was recorded on Nov 24, 2020 during the JFX-Days 2020.",

    "type": "Real World Application",
    "description": "Since the 1960s, indiscriminate fishing techniques using underwater explosives have been widespread across the coastal zone of Tanzania, Africa. So-called \"bomb fishing\" causes untold damage to the structures (e.g. coral reefs) and soundscapes of marine habitats and the animals within. At its recorded peak in 2016, tens of thousands of bomb blasts were visually recorded along the Tanzanian coastline, with many more likely undetected and unreported, representing a substantial and endemic conservation problem.\n \nGathering data on the location, timing and number of explosions over time is essential for understanding exactly when and where blasting occurs, for alerting enforcement in a timely manner, and for monitoring the effectiveness of any interventions. Listening for bomb blasts underwater (passive acoustic monitoring) has the great advantage over visual observation in that blasts can be detected during both the day and night, and this can be done over thousands of square kilometres.\n \nHowever, such acoustic monitoring schemes generate vast quantities of data which must be automatically analysed. Typically, a machine learning based approach would be used to build an accurate acoustic classifier, however, the combination of little training data on fish bomb blasts and the poorly documented soundscape of Tanzanian reefs mean that building an accurate automated classifier is difficult. Here we instead adopted a hybrid analysis approach, where we ran an automated detector that extracted any sound of interest, and then used JavaFX to build a highly interactive visualisation of the data. This enabled a manual analyst to quickly identify fish bomb blasts, allowing for months of raw data to be sifted through with the times and audio clips of fish bomb blasts extracted in a few hours, compared to the weeks of time it would have taken otherwise.\n \nJavaFX provided the means to build fast and intuitive data visualisation tools, an easy-to-use and attractive GUI, and critically, allowed this to be achieved on modest financial and time budgets. JavaFX enabled real-time conservation in the marine environments, and was key to the success of this (and other) wildlife conservation projects.",

    "description": "The video shows an add-on recently made for the \"presenter\" application of the XPS solution for sport teams / coaches. It enables the coach to create animations for a single frame of a video to visualize his observations and ideas. The last addition we recently made to this software is \"smart clipping\", which cuts out players so that the graphic objects (lines, polygons, etc....) will no longer be on top of the players but behind them. The solution delegates the work to a server. In this video we are still working with a slow test server. Performance will be better once the production server is in place.",
