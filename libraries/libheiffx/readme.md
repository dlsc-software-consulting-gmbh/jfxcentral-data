# LibHeifFX

Integration of the [Libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) library for JavaFX for all major operating systems (
Linux, Windows, OSX). All flavors of heif formats can be loaded with the Image class and manipulated by
Pixelwriter/Pixelreader. Limitation is that the image class only supports 8-bit color depth but converts all 16 bit
image formats to 8 bit automatically.

**JDK 17 is required** because of the foreign linker API usage and the big changes for threading happening in Panama in
JDK17

## Status

The lib is in beta status, which means it is tested only on MacOS X and under various threading scenarios.

Supported OS:

- Linux (min. glibc 2.27 which means Ubuntu 18 or later)
- OSX up to 10.15 (actually no M1 build)
- Windows 10/11

### Open topics

- The lib is not resizing the image data before sending back to the image class
- No meta data is read out actually
- Not enabled is AVIF support

## Usage

Point to the Maven coordinates:

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.libheiffx</groupId>
    <artifactId>LibHeifFX</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>  
```  

- In the class where the start method is added as one of the first lines the following code is used to install the file
  handler:

  `HEIFImageLoaderFactory.install();`

- and add the following lines to your java config:

```
--add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign --enable-native-access=org.libheiffx  
--add-exports=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio=org.libheiffx 
--add-exports=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio.common=org.libheiffx
```

- **Module name: org.libheiffx**

You can have a look into the class TestAPP.java to see how to use it, but generally just create an Image with the
URL/stream and add it to the image view:

```java
  Image img=new Image(initialFile.toURI().toURL().toString(),false);
        ImageView view=new ImageView();
        view.setFitHeight(200);
        view.setFitWidth(200);
        view.setPreserveRatio(true);
        stack.getChildren().add(view);
        view.setImage(img);
```  

You can also use the lib without adding the file handler. What I mean is that you can also forget the "...install" line
and just load a file URL with the lib (see the `TestApp.java` to see how it works).

## Notes:

- The lib is using unofficial JavaFX interfaces
- The orginal C interface was changed to get it working with project panama
- The lib is using heavily the foreign memory API from Java 17 including functions from the project Panama and therefore
  the tool `JExtract` (Available only in JDK 17)
- All classes inside of package `org.libheif.win` / `org.libheif.linuxosx` are generated by jextract but tuned for
  operating system specifica
- Inside these packages above I exposed also the raw interface to libheif
- The main class to interact with the native lib is the class `LibHeifImage.java` in package `org.libheiffx`
