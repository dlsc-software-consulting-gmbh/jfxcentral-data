## Core

* Message from **Kevin Rushforth** in the `openjfx-dev-request@openjdk.org` mailing list that shows how OpenJDK and OpenJFX keep being aligned thanks to the 6-months release cycle: "_I propose to remove support for running JavaFX applications with a security manager in JavaFX 24. Any JavaFX application that uses a security manager will necessarily need to use JDK 21.x LTS going forward, and thus can similarly use JavaFX 21.x LTS._"
  * See [JDK-8341090](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8341090): "The Java Security Manager was deprecated for removal in JDK 17 by [JEP 411](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411)."

## Applications

* [Gluon shared a screenshot](https://techhub.social/@gluonhq/113236888001051050) of the number of downloads of Scene Builder: "_Note how fast the adoption of Scene Builder 23 is! Work on 24 is in full-speed now._"
* [**Arkutu** is making progress](https://x.com/i_am_arkutu/status/1841480908492128687): "_building my healthcare desktop application using JavaFX, Spring Boot, and MySQL! So far, I've completed the login and main home page. Now, I'm diving into creating and fetching patient data from the database. Stay tuned for more updates._"

## Games

* [**Marino** released a tiny unorthodox project](https://x.com/MarinoDev/status/1839806509254881340) from a year ago [on itch](https://marinodev.itch.io/wander-javafx): "_A dungeon crawler made in JavaFX, also featuring 1-bit pixelart. Based on Miziziziz's 'Roguelike in a day' video._"

## Components, Libraries, Tools

*

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* **Frank Delporte** published a new "JavaFX In Action" interview: [JavaFX In Action with Christoph Schwentker about JabRef](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-10-01-jfxinaction-christoph-schwentker/), a tool written in Java and JavaFX to collect, organize, and discover literature for research projects.

## Tutorials

* **Frank Delporte** published a tutorial ["Template project to build a JavaFX application as a JAR with dependencies with Maven"](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-10-03-javafx-maven-jar-template/) with the source code on GitHub, full explanation in the blog, and a video walk-through on YouTube.

## Miscellaneous

* [In a Twitter thread, 21st Computer Tech](https://x.com/21stCompTech/status/1839657037896056852) compares Java and Python GUIs with this nice remark about Community & Support: "_Java has a large and active community for both Swing and JavaFX, with extensive documentation and examples available online._"
