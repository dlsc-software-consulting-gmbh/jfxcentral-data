## Core

* **Artur Skowronski** highlights in his [JVM Weekly newsletter](https://www.jvm-weekly.com/p/what-will-jdk-24-bring-jvm-weekly) some JavaFX facts:
  * _[JavaFX 23 announced by Kevin Rushforth](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/doc-files/release-notes-23.md) has hit the scene and brought with it a warning: "It's time to update." JavaFX has dropped support for older versions and will now require JDK 21._
  * _Oracle has [announced that support for JavaFX in JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html), the last version they released, will end in March next year._
* Reminder from last week: **Frank Delporte** also wrote about this change in the Oracle support for JavaFX in their Java 8 distributions: [End of the Road for JavaFX in JDK 8: Keeping Your Apps Alive](https://thenewstack.io/end-of-the-road-for-javafx-in-jdk-8-keeping-your-apps-alive/).
* [**SamFx** happily announced the merge of his first pull request into the OpenJFX code](https://x.com/SamNaFX/status/1817528341194252682) to fix "_Push Notification fails on Android when app closed_."

## Miscellaneous

* [**Homebookner** is looking for help](https://twitter.com/Heimbuchner_J/status/1845451366484914516): "_I'am currently implementing  a simple workspace control. I'm using splitpanes for the content, but when hiding and showing content in the splitpane, the divider jumps around. It seems not to happen, if the system setting for screen zoom is at 100%. Ideas?_"
