* **Frank Delporte** published a [new interview in his "JavaFX In Action" series with **Ulas Ergin**](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-10-22-jfxinaction-ulas-ergin/). He explains how his team at Credit Europe Bank uses JavaFX for two internal applications. The first one is a developer tool. Based on the experience of building this first tool, they decided to use JavaFX to migrate an old Swing-based application. The new Java application combines the old Swing screens with new React user interfaces, all nicely styled and integrated thanks to JavaFX.

* [**Loïc Lefèvre** hopes we like](https://x.com/Loic__Lefevre/status/1848390393252987106) this post, and we sure do ;-): "_Finally finished [this post about creating native images for JavaFX applications using GraalVM](https://medium.com/db-one/building-javafx-app-native-image-with-graalvm-new-achievement-unlocked-c5e236ecf11d). There is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loiclefevre/javafx-native) at the end._" 
  * Intro from the blog post: "_TL;DR — Building JavaFX application native image used to require GluonFX plugins and GluonHQ substrate VM. In this post, I show it is possible to rely on the latest GraalVM distribution only. This simplifies greatly the process but requires some challenges to be solved first… are you ready to read my journey?_"
